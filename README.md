## Lets review the basics
It's been a while since I used github, so I need to refresh my mind...

======

Way back then, I never used MarkDown format, but now I can:

1. Create numbered lists
    - Nested bullet lists
1. Format my text in:
    - __bold__
    + _italics_
    * ~~strike through~~
    - [Linls](http://duckduckgo.com)
    - `code`
    - ```var code = "formated"```
    - etc.
1. And way more...

------

This is another list:

1. I'll print a cheat-sheet
    - The one in this [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown Cheatsheet @ github") looks fine.
2. Tables are also possible:
    - There must be at least 3 dashes to separate each header cell.
    
    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
    
2. But lets start working now...
